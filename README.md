# Dialysis Appointment System

## Overview

The Dialysis Appointment System is designed to facilitate the booking of appointments for dialysis patients at the hospital. 
This system allows patients to manage their appointments, receive notifications, and access important hospital updates,
while enabling hospital admins to manage schedules and communicate effectively with patients. Patients can also book appointments 
with nephrologists, by having access to a list of curated specialists, and the open slots on their schedules, so that they can select
the most convenient slot for them, and it is added to their appointments queue.
